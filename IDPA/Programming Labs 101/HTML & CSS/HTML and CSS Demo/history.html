        <h2><em>Super Smash Bros. 64</em></h2>
        
        <p>
        	<em>Super Smash Bros. 64</em> (<em>Smash 64</em>) was released in 1999, but the competitive
            community for it was nonexistant until 2007, when netplay for it was discovered on emulators
            and the world started taking the game seriously. Now, the community for <em>Smash 64</em> is 
            relatively small compared two the next two installments of the series, but tournaments are
            still held fairly often, and <em>Smash 64</em> has been featured at international tournaments.
        </p>
        
        <h2><em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em></h2>
        
        <p>
        	<em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em> (<em>Melee</em>), was released in 2001 and was the birth
            of the competitive <em>Smash Bros.</em> community. It didn't really pick up steam until 2003,
            and at that point Major League Gaming (MLG) picked up <em>Melee</em> and ran tournaments for
            its pro circuit. Between 2006 - 2008 the competitive community for <em>Melee</em> started to fizzle, 
            but it quickly picked back up in 2009 and has continued to grow since, spawning a documentary (which
            you can find a link to in the navigation menu) and re-inclusion back into MLG's circuit.
        </p>
        
        <h2><em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em></h2>
        
        <p>
        	<em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em> (<em>Brawl</em>) was released in 2008 and almost killed the
            competitive <em>Melee</em> community. The game was very well-recieved by the competitive
            community at first, but around mid-2009 many players came to dislike it, and returned to <em>Melee</em>,
            sparking the rebirth of competitive <em>Melee</em> and a debate between these two games that has only
            just begun to fade.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Present Community</h2>
        
        <p>
        	Right now, the competitive <em>Smash Bros.</em> community has seen a resurgence it's never seen before.
            EVO, the largest Fighting Game Community (FGC) tournament, has finally accepted <em>Smash Bros</em> onto
            its roster, MLG is picking up <em>Melee</em> once again, and tournaments are cropping up everywhere with
            some of the largest turnouts the community has ever seen. <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> (for 3DS and Wii U, the 
            newest installment) is coming out this year and has generated a lot of hype for players of every game in the
            series. At the present, 2014 is a great time to be a competitive <em>Smash Bros.</em> player!
